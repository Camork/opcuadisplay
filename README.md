OPC UA Modeler for Eclipse

This prototype was created in the course of my Bachelor Thesis at the Institute of Enterprise Systems at the University of Mannheim.
It contains a modeler for OPC UA Information Models as an Eclipse Plugin. 

The software was also been presented in the course of the Modellierung 2018 conference. [Link to the paper](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2060/mekes1.pdf) 

## Features:
- create a new OPC UA Information Model from scratch or with the basic types and variables
- load an existing OPC UA Information Model from a running OPC UA Server
- import an existing OPC UA Information Model from an XML File
- merge an existing OPC UA Information Model from an XML File into the current model
- edit the model (Nodes with Objects, Variables, Methods, Types, etc. can be edited, added and removed)
